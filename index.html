        <h2>These are some of the qualities that make the Stratocaster unique:</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>The first Fender guitar to feature three pickups and a spring tension vibrato system.</li>
            <li>It's double cutaways allowed players easier access to higher positions on the neck.</li>  
            <li>The bridge novel mechanism pivots on a fulcrum design with a six screw bridge plate, allowing the whole set-up to "float" while transferring the strings energy directly into the body.</li>
            <li>Stratocasterâ€™s electronics were mounted to the single-ply white plastic pickguard.</li>
        </ul>
